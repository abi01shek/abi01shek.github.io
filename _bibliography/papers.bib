abstract = {Hybrid computing platforms, comprising CPU cores and FPGA logic, are increasingly used for accelerating data-intensive workloads in cloud deployments, and are a growing topic of interest in systems research. However, from a research perspective, existing hardware platforms are limited: they are often optimized for concrete, narrow use-cases and, therefore lack the flexibility needed to explore other applications and configurations.  We show that a research group can design and build a more general, open, and affordable hardware platform for hybrid systems research. The platform, Enzian, is capable of duplicating the functionality of existing CPU/FPGA systems with comparable performance but in an open, flexible system. It couples a large FPGA with a server-class CPU in an asymmetric cache-coherent NUMA system. Enzian also enables research not possible with existing hybrid platforms, through explicit access to coherence messages, extensive thermal and power instrumentation, and an open, programmable baseboard management processor.  Enzian is already being used in multiple projects, is open source (both hardware and software), and available for remote use. We present the design principles of Enzian, the challenges in building it, and evaluate it with a range of existing research use-cases alongside other, more specialized platforms, as well as demonstrating research not possible on existing platforms.},

	abstract = {FPGA-based accelerators are becoming pervasive in the cloud and data centers due to their architectural flexibility (they are used in many different configurations) and functionality (they can be reconfigured and reprogrammed at runtime). At the same time, standards like CXL raise questions of how a cache coherence protocol should be presented to heterogeneous applications running on, for example, a closely-coupled FPGA-based accelerator. To address these questions, we present CCKit, an open-source toolkit comprising a complete cache coherency stack for FPGAs with software support, and enabling interesting and novel designs beyond simple coherence or, indeed, any requirement for caching on the FPGA. We describe the implementation of CCKit in detail, show through benchmarks that it is highly competitive with hardware-based implementations, but also, critically, that it enables important use-cases for CPU-FPGA coherence beyond those supported by emerging standards.},

abstract = {Mechanisms to explicitly manage data persistence for non-volatile main memories are fundamental for the correctness and performance of modern systems. So far, however, most solutions are primarily based on software techniques. In this paper, we design a persistence layer on hardware, to support correct handling of persistent lock-free data structures. By exploiting cache-coherence messages, persistence can be transparently managed by the hardware, with minimal user intervention. We have experimented with a partial design on a Soft-CPU running on an FPGA to explore the idea, and plan to further extend it into a real hardware implementation.},
