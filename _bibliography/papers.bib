	abstract = {FPGA-based accelerators are becoming pervasive in the cloud and data centers due to their architectural flexibility (they are used in many different configurations) and functionality (they can be reconfigured and reprogrammed at runtime). At the same time, standards like CXL raise questions of how a cache coherence protocol should be presented to heterogeneous applications running on, for example, a closely-coupled FPGA-based accelerator. To address these questions, we present CCKit, an open-source toolkit comprising a complete cache coherency stack for FPGAs with software support, and enabling interesting and novel designs beyond simple coherence or, indeed, any requirement for caching on the FPGA. We describe the implementation of CCKit in detail, show through benchmarks that it is highly competitive with hardware-based implementations, but also, critically, that it enables important use-cases for CPU-FPGA coherence beyond those supported by emerging standards.},
