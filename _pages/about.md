Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a systems researcher and graduated recently from the [Institute of Computing Platforms (Systems Group)](https://systems.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich with a doctoral degree. I am interested in emerging coherent interconnects and its impact on FPGA acceleration in a cloud setting. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked at Qualcomm for 5 years as a post-silicon validation engineer with experience in Design for Test (DfT), CAD tool development and yield improvement. I love learning new things and enjoy having discussions and working in collaborative environments.

During my doctoral studies, I was part of the research team that built [Enzian](https://enzian.systems/). I implemented an open, customizable, and performant cache coherence stack on the FPGA to demonstrate for the first time that an FPGA can be a peer to a server-grade CPU in the coherence protocol [Gitlab](https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/project-openenzian/fpga-stack/directory-controller-slice). Through this process I picked up skills for reverse engineering coherence protocols from their traces, as well as modeling and verifying them. I used this coherence stack to research non-traditional acceleration models on FPGAs.
